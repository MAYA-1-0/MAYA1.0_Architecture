* The measurements for the body parts have been taken from the same previously mentioned anthropometric * reference.
* The entire design is covered externally by body panels, which provide support and give a good aesthetic appearance.
* The motor incorporated in the design is Dynamixel XM-430.

A female humanoid is often preferred in social and service robots as they are perceived as less threatening or more friendly than their male counterparts. The appearance of a humanoid robot consists of frame structures that function as skeletons and housings For frame components that support the weight of humanoid robot and generate movement, a very precise engineering approach is required and this step of the design process, the frame requirements, Kinematics and generate the conceptual designs based on the generated requirements.
